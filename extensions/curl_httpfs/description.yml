  extended_description: |
    This extension rewrites HTTP layer for httpfs based on libcurl and epoll, it provides a few features:
    - 100% compatible with httpfs; use curl-based implementation by default, but also allows users to fallback to httplib.
    - Enable HTTP/2 by default.
    - Implements TCP connection pool.
    - All network IO operations are performed in asynchronously.
