    This extension provides observability to duckdb filesystems.
    It supports a few key features:
    - 100% compatible with duckdb httpfs
    - Provides both process-wise and bucket-wise latency stats (including histogram and quantile estimation) to all read operations
    - Provides cache access insight to duckdb external file cache
    - Allows registering ANY duckdb compatible filesystems (i.e., azure filesystem)
