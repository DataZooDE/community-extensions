    The EEA Reference Grid extension adds support for working with the [EEA Reference Grid System](https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/catalogue/srv/api/records/aac8379a-5c4e-445c-b2ef-23a6a2701ef0/attachments/eea_reference_grid_v1.pdf).

    The **EEA Reference Grid** is a standardized spatial grid system used across Europe for environmental data analysis and reporting. It is maintained by the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en) (EEA) and forms the basis for aggregating and exchanging geospatial data in a consistent format:

      * `Coordinate Reference System (CRS)`: ETRS89 / LAEA Europe ([EPSG:3035](https://epsg.io/3035)), which minimizes area distortion across Europe. The Geodetic Datum is the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (EPSG:6258). The Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection is centred at 10°E, 52°N. Coordinates are based on a false Easting of 4321000 meters, and a false Northing of 3210000 meters.
      * `Supported resolutions`: Typically available at 10 km, 1 km, and 100 m resolutions.
      * `Structure`: Regular square grid with unique cell codes and identifiers assigned based on position and resolution.
      * `Purpose`: Enables harmonized spatial analysis, mapping, and cross-border environmental assessments.

    This grid system is widely used in European environmental datasets, including air quality, land use, biodiversity, and climate change indicators.

    The extension provides functions to calculate grid cell identifiers (`INT64`) from XY coordinates based on the `EPSG:3035` coordinate reference system, and vice versa. Please see the [function table](docs/functions.md) for the current implementation status.
